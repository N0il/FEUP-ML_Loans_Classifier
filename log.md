- datas dos dados -> epoca especifica do pais -> new business understanding
- dados de teste da competição serão posteriores aos dados das tabelas -> melhor usar dados mais recentes para teste? not sure, must check data plots

## Week 1 - 19/09/2022

## Data mining context:

- __Aplication Domain__: Loan Acceptance Prediction.
- __Problem Type__: Prediction.
- __Technical Aspect__: TODO.
- __Tool and Technique__: Python (TODO - add libraries, etc).

## Business understanding:
### Objectives
- __Background__: Bank managers only have a vague idea if a certain client should receive a loan.
- __Business objective__: Improve the bank's lending service by predicting which clients should receive loans.
- __Business Success criteria__: Reduce the percentage of bad loans given by the bank. 
### Assess Situation
- __Inventory and Assumptions__: We are working with a given set of data which we assume to be correct.
- __Risk and Contingencies__: may contain outliers in the data. (TODO - To be dealt with in data preparation.)
### Data mining goals
- __Goals__: Predict which clients should receive a loan based on the available data (TODO - complete goal with actually used data)
- __Data Mining Success criteria__: Create predictions on which clients should get loans that as an accuracy of at least 90%.

## Week 2 - 26/09/2022

## TODO:
- Data division for evaluation, etc.
- Build first model (eg. Decision Tree - Random Forest)

## Data Splitting and Model Evaluation Methods

### Data Splitting Method

Seeing as our dataset on loans isn't big enough to make a division 

### Model Evaluation Method

__TODO__
