## Data mining context:

- __Aplication Domain__: Loan Acceptance Prediction.
- __Problem Type__: Prediction.
- __Technical Aspect__: TODO.
- __Tool and Technique__: Python (TODO - add libraries, etc).

## Business understanding:
### Objectives
- __Background__: Bank managers only have a vague idea if a certain client should receive a loan.
- __Business objective__: Improve the bank's lending service by predicting which clients should receive loans.

### Assess Situation
- __Inventory and Assumptions__: We are working with a given set of data which we assume to be correct.
- __Risk and Contingencies__: may contain outliers in the data. (TODO - To be dealt with in data preparation.)
### Data mining goals
- __Goals__: Predict which clients should receive a loan based on the available data (TODO - complete goal with actually used data)
- __Data Mining Success criteria__: Create predictions on which clients should get loans that as an accuracy of at least 90%.
